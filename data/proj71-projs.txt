Our objectives are to determine foraging behavior of incubating and chick-rearing terns (i.e. number of foraging trips per day, length of foraging trips, flight direction of foraging trips, and daily patterns of activity). WE want to compare foraging patterns between incubation and chick rearing terns.

This region is primarily active with fish, lobster, and shellfish harbesting, and represents a relatively undisturbed area compared to coastal areas in southern Maine that are heavily used by beach-goers. Birds were captured on feeding areas (mudflats) via passive mistnetting during low tide, and at roost sites on offshore rock ledge by hand-held rocket netting from a small boat during high tide. All tagged SESAs were subsequently detected and showed regular, tide-cycle-dependent movements between feeding areas along the rivers leading into Narraguagus Bay and offshore ledge roost sites.  In general, juvenile (HY) birds were more likely to be in lower body condition (fat-free mass) compared to adults and showed a longer post-deployment period leading to departure than adults did. A significant finding in this study is the confirmation that birds staging in this area depart directly from it to embark on a trans-oceanic flight to Central/So America.  In both years, none of the SESAs tagged at this site were detected in areas to the north/east or south.  This is in contrast to birds tagged on stopover in southern Maine and illustrates the importance of the Downeast sites in supporting efficient migration.  In 2015-16, this project will move to southern Maine to investigate stopover behavior at two areas of high human activity to compare within-site movements, stopover period, and departure decisions of these birds to those Downeast, and to determine currently unknown feeding and roosting sites.",

    "descriptionLong": "Wind energy development is promoted by both governmental and nonprofit entities as an environmentally friendly alternative to greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.  However, wind farms can have negative impacts on wildlife, including bats (GAO 2005).  A recent study estimated 600,000 bats were killed by wind power in the United States in 2012 (Hayes 2013).\n\nThe effects of wind development on bat populations may be especially detrimental to migratory tree and foliage-roosting bats, which comprise about 75% of all fatalities reported in North America (Arnett et al. 2008).  In the northeastern United States, long-distance migrants include the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the eastern red bat (L. borealis), and the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans).  These species face the greatest risks during their fall migration southward, with mortality at wind farms peaking during this season (Arnett et al. 2008).  Little is known about the timing, routes, or drivers of migration in these species, or why they are particularly vulnerable to wind farm mortality during fall migration.  \n\nMajor bat migratory pathways in the northeastern U.S. have not been identified, but songbirds often follow coastal routes during migration, and it has been hypothesized that North American bats may follow similar pathways (Cryan 2003, Johnson et al. 2011).  Recent acoustic surveys in the Gulf of Maine have found activity of migratory bat species to be higher in coastal areas compared to inland sites (Stantec 2012), supporting the idea that coastal areas may serve as migratory pathways.  \n\nThis study will take advantage of the automated telemetry station network, in order to monitor late summer and fall movements of migratory bat species.  The goals of this research are 1) to monitor the coastal and offshore movements of migratory bats along the Eastern Seaboard, 2) to better characterize bat migration, including timing of movements, stopover, etc., and 3) to analyze diets of coastal migratory bats, to explore whether insect populations may serve as a driver of migration.  A better understanding of bat migration can greatly improve our knowledge of how populations will react to wind development, as well as inform minimization efforts and wind energy regulation. \n",

More specifically, we want to determine whether these species shift their home ranges from nesting sites to nearby early-seral stands for a berry-dominated diet. Another study (Auk 129:419-426,2012) documented heavy use of Sambucus berries in this landscape by migrant forest songbirds, which suggest an important role for early-seral stands here. Of course, we are also interested in documenting species, age, and sex-specific differences in migration.\n\nStudying migration and dispersal at the same time requires some creativity in the use of SensorGnome receptors. We combine three reception strategies for coded transmitters, namely: fixed towers, car-mounted, and drone-mounted SensorGnomes, to obtain data to infer species presence and departure times, landscape-scale movements (< 100 km2), and hopefully, higher-resolution habitat selection.\n\nWe nanotag birds in two locations: Forêt Montmorency (FM) and Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (OOT). At the FM, we focus on post-breeding movements with a concentration of 6 MOTUS stations in a ~ 100 km2 area. The Observatoire de'oiseaux de Tadoussac is used to capture SWTH and GCTH and fit nanotags on them specifically to document their fall migration. To this end, we have deployed receiving stations along the St-Lawrence estuary and river.\n\nAs of 28 September 2016, we tagged 155 SWTH, 27 GCTH and 28 BITH in summer (Forêt Montmorency) and Fall (Tadoussac). \n\nNB - Receiver Deployment information under project 3.

However, stopover sites are unfamiliar places full of risks for birds. This means that bird behavior at these sites is critical to detemrine whether individuals succeed on to the next stage of migration. Current technology allows to obtain both, fine-scale movement data at a local scale, as well as to follow the movements of birds across continents. We will integrate behavioral data with remote tracking to understand how birds choose between habitats in a landscape matrix, how long they spend fuelling and if this varies in individuals of different age or sex. Furthermore, we hope that the MOTUS continental alliance, through its network of radio towers, will provide precise information about the duration of migration and migratory routes of this and other species.\n\nDr. Camila Gomez\nDr. Nick Bayly\nDr. Keith Hobson\nDr. Daniel Cadena\n\n3) Stopover ecology of migratory landbirds in the Caribbean tropical dry forests of Colombia\nIn 2016, occupancy surveys carried out under the Neotropical Flyways Project identified tropical dry forests as a key stopover habitat during spring migration for a range of species that over-winter elsewhere in South America. This previously unknown role of these forests in maintaining migratory processes, highlights the need for increasing our knowledge of how birds use these areas. This need is even more critical given that tropical dry forests have lost 92% of their original cover in Colombia and are used by declining migrants such as Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Alder Flycatcher and Mourning Warbler. The deployment of Motus tags in this project will enable the estimation of key parameters of stopover behavior, such as duration, as well as describe onward migratory strategies.\n\nDr. Nick Bayly\nDr. Keith Hobson\nDr. Ken Rosenberg\nAna María Gonzalez\n\n4) Pre-migratory fueling in Colombia and spring migration strategies in Blackpoll Warbler\nBlackpoll Warbler are known for remarkable endurance flights over the Atlantic Ocean during fall migration but their spring migration strategy is largely unknown.

When birds are kept in cages during migration, they show nocturnal activity, “migratory restlessness”. The temporal pattern and intensity of migratory restlessness is endogenously controlled. However, changes in photoperiod, temperature, and body condition modulate the seasonal pattern. These factors also influence the departure probability of a migrant at a stopover site. Although the circannual and circadian rhythms in migrants and their realised migration behaviour are well studied, we have little information (i) about the start of nocturnal migratory restlessness and the onset of nocturnal migration, (ii) whether both traits are temporally related, (iii) whether they are strongly endogenous controlled, and (iv) which exogenous factors influence the timing of both traits.\nThe onset of nocturnal migration defines the potential flight range per night. The seasonal sum of all potential flight ranges per night influences total speed of migration which in turn affects the timing of migration. For our understanding of migration it is essential investigating which endogenous and exogenous factors influence the onset of nocturnal migration.\n\tBy combining cage experiments to determine the start of nocturnal migratory restlessness and radio telemetry to identify the onset of nocturnal migration for the same individual we will (i) describe the temporal pattern of both traits, (ii) whether both traits correlate temporally with each other and identify how (iii) endogenous and (iv) exogenous factors influence the timing of both traits within the night. To this end, Northern Wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) will be caught on Helgoland a small island in the North Sea. On migration the nominate form breeding in Scandinavian and the leucorhoa subspecies breeding on Island, Greenland, and in Canada pass regularly Helgoland. As they all winter in sub-Sahelian Africa, populations have depending on their breeding areas different remaining migration distances from Helgoland in spring but not in autumn. This framework allows testing differences in both traits in respect of total migration distance [endogenous factor], remaining migration distance, temperature, body condition and weather [all exogenous factors].\n",

We envision the area around Grünau im Almtal, not far from the city of Salzburg, where a research station of the University of Vienna is located.\n\nWith these two study areas we will be able to answer questions about the behaviour of migrants facing the mountains as an ecological barrier on their southbound migration. We will look at effects of adverse weather, phenology, and other factors on the strategies of migration, and will be able to directl< compare sites at the mountain edge with sites in the Eastern plains, where no barrier is present.\n\nDepending on deals with landowners and on the preparation of the receivers, the Neusiedler See network should be established in the fall 2017.

    "descriptionLong": "The mechanisms regulating populations are poorly understood and controversial, yet elucidating them is essential for predicting how populations will respond to environmental perturbations such as climate change. The combination of the exogenous (e.g. climate) and endogenous (e.g. dispersal limitation) forces acting upon a population will determine its fate, including the probability that a population goes extinct, and the probability that new populations will be established as a result of colonisations. In this project we will address one of the most pertinent questions in ecology, which relates to the relative roles of abiotic and biotic factors in shaping patterns of species abundance, distribution, and spatio-temporal population dynamics. As all population-level phenomena can be derived from individual-level processes, our starting point for assessing population dynamics is to understand how individual-level processes (e.g. dispersal patterns and group movement dynamics) translate to populaion-level processes,  as well as to understand how individual-level process are modified by the population context. Our biological model is one of the most emblematic passerine species of alpine environments in European mountains, the snowfinch Montifringilla nivalis nivalis. As most organisms inhabiting alpine environments, the snowfinch is potentially threatened by loss of habitat, range contraction and local extinction due to global warming. However, we still know very little about its ecological requirements and essentially nothing about its demography in order to adequately assess its vulnerability. By identifying the mechanisms limiting population locally, and mechanistically linking the dynamics of the populations with climatic variability, we aim to gain insights into the relative importance of abiotic a biotic factors on the spatio-temporal dynamics of snowfinch populations - the results of which is a fundamental requirement in order to assess how alpine species adapated to cold climate will face new warming conditions. We believe that the project will serve as an important case study that will significantly advance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of bird populations in alpine environments, a topic for which a general synthesis is very important but still lacking. Thus, we expect that our results and methods will be applicable also to other researchers. The project is therefore expected to make significant advance in the 'state of the art' of alpine habitat conservation and management in Europe, as well as to get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying alpine bird responses to climate change.",

Throughout the breeding period, birds in the dosing group will be supplemental fed in the field with mealworms that have been maintained on a diet containing an environmentally relevant concentration of methylmercury-cysteine while birds in the control group will receive clean mealworms.Ovenbirds that breed in Connecticut and elsewhere east of the Appalachian Mountains migrate to the Caribbean islands for the winter. The fall migration route likely follows the Atlantic Coast, passes through the Florida peninsula, and then continues either east to the Bahamas or south to the Greater Antilles. As such,we expect that the majority of the birds will be detected when they reach the “fence” of Motus towers that currently stretches east-west across northern Florida. The dates on which birds are detected in Florida relative to the date they left their breeding grounds in Connecticut will allow us to calculate and compare the speed (flight and stopover periods combined) with which mercury-dosed and non-dosed birds moved south. The proportion of birds from each group that are detected in Florida will also indicate the influence of mercury on the likelihood of ovenbirds completing that leg of their journey.",

On the SGP, however, decreasing availability of surface water on saline lakes is an additional limiting factor to Snowy Plover nest success and survival. What remains unknown about Snowy Plovers on the SGP is the existence, level and degree of population connectivity among regional saline lakes and other breeding areas. This is important to regional conservation efforts; identifying those populations that are most isolated is the first step identifying management effort direction.

    "descriptionLong": "To provide accurate environmental impact assessments in urban environments, it is important to understand how sensitive species, such as migrating birds, use those environments. Moult-migrant songbirds perform extended stopovers during migration in order to moult their feathers before reaching their wintering grounds. Stopover habitats are therefore of great importance to the continued survival of these species. However, as urbanization keeps altering habitat throughout the world, many of these important areas are disappearing or are under constant threat of development. In this study, we will investigate how molt-migrants are using the landscape during moulting stopovers in one of the largest metropolis in Canada and where migratory birds from large swathes of the boreal forest migrate past, the island of Montreal. We will determine the fall stopover duration, fine-scale habitat use and departure decisions of moult-migrant Swainson’s thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and Tennessee Warblers (Leiothlypis peregrina) using the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. We will deploy radio transmitters on several individuals of both species at an important migratory bird stopover area located in the western tip of the island of Montreal. We will then record their daily general location and movements through an array of 3 automated radio telemetry towers set up in the surrounding areas of our study site. Using manual radio telemetry, we will follow and monitor each individual bird throughout the duration of its stopover and record behaviour and habitat use. We will assess the duration of stopover, stopover behaviour and departure decisions as a function of species, age, moulting stage, body condition and local weather conditions. We will also associate behavioural data with the signal strengths detected by the towers with the hopes of creating activity budgets of the tagged birds based on our behavioural data validated in the field.

    "descriptionLong": "Common Nighthawks and Eastern Whip-poor-wills are declining precipitously throughout their respective ranges, and if either or both species face an ecological trap, identifying it will be crucial in mitigating conservation efforts. Nighthawks and whip-poor- wills are migratory, crepuscular, cryptic ground-nesting birds that belong to the nightjar family. Breeding Bird Survey data from 1966-2011 indicate that Common Nighthawk numbers have dropped by -2.2%/year across their summer range (Sauer et al. 2013), and provincial and national trends from 2002-2012 show that in Canada, Eastern Whip-poor-wills are declining at a rate between -2.77%/year and -5.53%/year (Environment Canada 2015). Both nightjars are listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act, but given their secretive nature and relative difficulty of researching nightjars, knowledge gaps have prevented us from pinpointing a direct cause of these declines. The primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate the potential influence of roadways on Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will breeding success and increase our understanding of factors driving their range- wide declines. My goals include improving methods for nightjar nest-monitoring and conservation of both species. Given the aforementioned aspects of nighthawk and whip-poor-will breeding ecology combined with numerous possible attractive features of roadways, it is impossible to overlook the potential threats to survival posed by even a single high-speed road cutting through otherwise appropriate habitat. We hypothesize that roadways bisecting breeding habitat for the Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will may present an ecological trap either in the classical sense, where adults erroneously favour poor-quality habitat near roadway edges over more suitable open woodlands and suffer reduced fitness as a result, or alternatively as an equal preference trap where nighthawks and whip-poor-wills in close proximity to roadways experience consequences to fitness from which those remaining in the habitat interior are exempt. Conversely, nighthawks and whip-poor-wills may be able to recognize the poorer quality of roadside habitats and avoid them altogether, resulting in much higher density of nighthawks and whip-poor-wills located a significant distance from the road’s edge.\nObjectives:\nObtain refined knowledge of territory size and movements on Common Nighthawks and Eastern Whip-poor-wills on breeding grounds in Ontario\nFirst known-fate study of Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will nestlings through the post-fledging period\nCollect data on potential anthropogenic threat (high-speed roadways) to Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will reproductive success\nInformation gained will help to augment strategies for conservation managment and mitigation of species decline",

Specifically, we propose to attach nanotags to a sample of Second Year and After Second Year male Painted Buntings and document their home range and territory sizes.  Based on the female mimicry hypothesis, we plan to test the prediction that SY males should range relatively widely by visiting multiple Painted Bunting territories, whereas ASY males should confine their movements primarily to within their home territories.\n\nFurther, by using nanotags as part of the MOTUS system we will be able to answer several questions related to Painted Bunting southward migration.  We have an established automated MOTUS receiving station at our study area, the Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA).  Thus, the MOTUS system should allow us to detect nanotagged Painted Buntings daily as long as they remain on their breeding territories.  As soon as a signal is not detected, we should be able to determine the exact day or evening that individual Painted Buntings initiated migration.  There are also 18 automated MOTUS receiving systems located along the Gulf Coast from Galveston to Brownsville, Texas, 500-900 km south and southeast of our LLELA study area.  If our nanotagged Painted Buntings migrate more-or-less directly southward to the Gulf Coast, the MOTUS stations on the Gulf Coast have a relatively high probability of detecting our tagged birds.     \n",

    "descriptionLong": "The objectives of this study are to utilize several bird tracking technologies to answer some fundamental questions regarding habitat use, movement patterns and winter survivorship in this species. Specifically, we plan to use miniature light-level geolocators to better define the breeding range, migration routes, and migration timing of wintering American Tree Sparrows. While powerful, geolocators must be recovered from individual birds recaptured during a subsequent winter, and we will be extending considerable effort to recapture birds carrying geolocators. Given that return rates of birds between winters is quite low, we expect to only recover a small percentage of transmitters. To bolster our sample sizes and better define the breeding grounds for this species, we also plan to use stable isotopes from feathers. This method will allow us to define the regional breeding range for a much larger sample of birds, without the need to subsequently recapture birds. Finally, we also plan to attach coded transmitters (e.g. Nanotags) to a subset of birds as a means of tracking local bird movements during winter. Since Nanotags communicate with a dense external network of towers, once transmitters are deployed, birds do not have to be recaptured and transmitters do not have to be recovered to retrieve data. Nanotags can track bird movements at much finer spatial scales than geolocators, but their lifespan is much shorter. Through a combined approach, also using stationary and hand-held receivers and field observations, we plan to use these tracking technologies to further our understanding of movement and habitat use in this species. The goal of this project is to identify critical stages and locations within the annual cycle that, through conservation and management, lead to actions which slow or reverse population declines.",

The status of TRBL is also currently under formal review for Federal listing under the Endangered Species Act.  Breeding by Tricolored Blackbirds in low elevation grasslands in the foothills surrounding California’s Central Valley (“foothill grasslands”) has been well documented but relatively little is known about these populations.  Ariola (et al. 2015) estimated that 30% of the state’s TRBL population occurs in these areas.  However, there is insufficient data on the movements of these birds, including whether these populations are year-long residents, migrants, or a mix of both.  In the Kern River Valley, some of the birds also appear to shift breeding sites during the breeding season.  We plan to fit 30 TRBLs (from at least two separate colonies) with nanoTags to track their movements within the Kern River Valley.  We hope to continue and expand this study in future years to track the movements of TRBLs throughout the area.",

We will use the existing network of towers, and erect new stations in areas where we have some gaps in order to obtain information on contemporary migration patterns and to annually estimate adult survival rates.\n\nAs a pilot feasibility study, we plan to trap geese on Prince Edward Island during the spring migration and equip a subset (100) birds with nanotags (Lotek NTQB-6-2; 2 years life span) to determine detection on geese in subsequent seasons. Spring banding on PEI had previously been an operational program, but due to an inability to capture and band hatch year geese, safety concerns over rocket charges, and difficulties in banding adequate numbers of geese (estimated at 600-700 AHY annually), this was abandoned in favor of a breeding ground banding effort.  Many of the fields that had previously be used held geese in spring 2018, so the expectation is that we will be able to reinstitute banding programs in those areas moving forward.\n\nWe will leg band and deploy nanotags on all geese captured.  Radios will be attached to geese using a standard Teflon® harness.  By continuing this program over multiple years, we hope to be able to obtain data on migration timing and routes for up to 7 years, and a time series of mark-recapture information for survival rate estimation of a similar duration.  By marking birds with both leg bands and nanotag technology, we will be able to maximize the information return on our investment.  Our intent is to conduct traditional band return analyses in conjunction with the estimates of survival derived from the nanotags.  This would enable us utilize our sample of banded and telemetered NAP geese most effectively.  \n\nIf satisfied with the detection rates after the first year of banding on PEI, we expect to transition to the breeding grounds and annually capture both adult flocks and brood flocks in Labrador and Newfoundland, as well as potentially continuing the spring banding in PEI.  As a hedge, we anticipate deploying a limited number of GSM/GPS units on adults as a test against the nanotag deployments and to get more complete life histories on breeding geese in Labrador and Newfoundland. In this case, sample sizes are considerably reduced from that required when relying solely on leg banded birds to provide survival and harvest rate information.",
