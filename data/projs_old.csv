In 2012-13, we tagged terns on Petit Manan Island. In 2014-15, we tagged terns on Metinic, Matinicus Rock, and Seal Islands. We also tagged a small number of common terns on Ship Island in 2014.  Our objectives are to determine foraging behavior of incubating and chick-rearing terns (i.e. number of foraging trips per day, length of foraging trips, flight direction of foraging trips, and daily patterns of activity). WE want to compare foraging patterns between incubation and chick rearing terns. Ideally we would like to identify foraging locations but the offshore location of breeding colonies does generally not allow for nearby towers. We are also using data collected after the terns disperse from the colonies to identify migration pathways and staging areas.","Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge has been tagging common and Arctic terns on a number of breeding colonies in Maine since 2012."

This region is primarily active with fish, lobster, and shellfish harbesting, and represents a relatively undisturbed area compared to coastal areas in southern Maine that are heavily used by beach-goers. Birds were captured on feeding areas (mudflats) via passive mistnetting during low tide, and at roost sites on offshore rock ledge by hand-held rocket netting from a small boat during high tide. All tagged SESAs were subsequently detected and showed regular, tide-cycle-dependent movements between feeding areas along the rivers leading into Narraguagus Bay and offshore ledge roost sites.  In general, juvenile (HY) birds were more likely to be in lower body condition (fat-free mass) compared to adults and showed a longer post-deployment period leading to departure than adults did. A significant finding in this study is the confirmation that birds staging in this area depart directly from it to embark on a trans-oceanic flight to Central/So America.  In both years, none of the SESAs tagged at this site were detected in areas to the north/east or south.  This is in contrast to birds tagged on stopover in southern Maine and illustrates the importance of the Downeast sites in supporting efficient migration.  In 2015-16, this project will move to southern Maine to investigate stopover behavior at two areas of high human activity to compare within-site movements, stopover period, and departure decisions of these birds to those Downeast, and to determine currently unknown feeding and roosting sites.","In 2013-14, we tracked movements of ~ 75 Semipalmated Sandpipers in Downeast Maine to better understand stopover habitat use."

32,2014-01-01,"Dowling","Dowling","Wind energy development is promoted by both governmental and nonprofit entities as an environmentally friendly alternative to greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.  However, wind farms can have negative impacts on wildlife, including bats (GAO 2005).  A recent study estimated 600,000 bats were killed by wind power in the United States in 2012 (Hayes 2013).

The effects of wind development on bat populations may be especially detrimental to migratory tree and foliage-roosting bats, which comprise about 75% of all fatalities reported in North America (Arnett et al. 2008).  In the northeastern United States, long-distance migrants include the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the eastern red bat (L. borealis), and the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans).  These species face the greatest risks during their fall migration southward, with mortality at wind farms peaking during this season (Arnett et al. 2008).  Little is known about the timing, routes, or drivers of migration in these species, or why they are particularly vulnerable to wind farm mortality during fall migration.  

Major bat migratory pathways in the northeastern U.S. have not been identified, but songbirds often follow coastal routes during migration, and it has been hypothesized that North American bats may follow similar pathways (Cryan 2003, Johnson et al. 2011).  Recent acoustic surveys in the Gulf of Maine have found activity of migratory bat species to be higher in coastal areas compared to inland sites (Stantec 2012), supporting the idea that coastal areas may serve as migratory pathways.  

This study will take advantage of the automated telemetry station network, in order to monitor late summer and fall movements of migratory bat species.  The goals of this research are 1) to monitor the coastal and offshore movements of migratory bats along the Eastern Seaboard, 2) to better characterize bat migration, including timing of movements, stopover, etc., and 3) to analyze diets of coastal migratory bats, to explore whether insect populations may serve as a driver of migration.  A better understanding of bat migration can greatly improve our knowledge of how populations will react to wind development, as well as inform minimization efforts and wind energy regulation.

Project Goals:
-To improve indices of abundance that may be used to monitor trends in shorebird populations staging along the western James Bay coast;
-To improve our understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of habitat/resource use and potential causes for their variation;
-To improve  identification of important shorebird staging habitats based on recent shorebird research and traditional ecological knowledge;
-To recommend protection of habitat, and nomination of WHSRN site(s) for western James Bay if supported by the data and required; and
-Further, to gain information on the migration and staging ecology of the Red Knot leading to protection of habitat from damage and destruction under the provincial Endangered Species Act.

Annual Objectives: 
-Quantify use of known Red Knot foraging and roosting locations;
-Use known staging area data to predict other staging areas along the James Bay coast and determine their use by shorebirds;
-Estimate the numbers and monitor temporal patterns of southbound migration of all shorebird species, including phenology of adults and juveniles;
-Identify and where possible delineate foraging areas and roosts used by staging shorebirds  ;
-Estimate annual variation in indices of abundance of staging shorebirds;
-Determine habitat use by shorebirds at the project survey sites; and
-Identify and record marked individuals (e.g., nanotags, leg flags and alphanumeric codes).","Multi-agency shorebird monitoring on the western coast of James Bay."

More specifically, we want to determine whether these species shift their home ranges from nesting sites to nearby early-seral stands for a berry-dominated diet. Another study (Auk 129:419-426,2012) documented heavy use of Sambucus berries in this landscape by migrant forest songbirds, which suggest an important role for early-seral stands here. Of course, we are also interested in documenting species, age, and sex-specific differences in migration.

Studying migration and dispersal at the same time requires some creativity in the use of SensorGnome receptors. We combine three reception strategies for coded transmitters, namely: fixed towers, car-mounted, and drone-mounted SensorGnomes, to obtain data to infer species presence and departure times, landscape-scale movements (< 100 km2), and hopefully, higher-resolution habitat selection.

We nanotag birds in two locations: Forêt Montmorency (FM) and Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (OOT). At the FM, we focus on post-breeding movements with a concentration of 6 MOTUS stations in a ~ 100 km2 area. The Observatoire de'oiseaux de Tadoussac is used to capture SWTH and GCTH and fit nanotags on them specifically to document their fall migration. To this end, we have deployed receiving stations along the St-Lawrence estuary and river.

1)Landscape use and continental movement patterns of Gray-cheeked Thrush: 
The duration of migration is mostly determined by the length of stopovers made between the site of origin and that of final destination. However, stopover sites are unfamiliar places full of risks for birds. This means that bird behavior at these sites is critical to detemrine whether individuals succeed on to the next stage of migration. Current technology allows to obtain both, fine-scale movement data at a local scale, as well as to follow the movements of birds across continents. We will integrate behavioral data with remote tracking to understand how birds choose between habitats in a landscape matrix, how long they spend fuelling and if this varies in individuals of different age or sex. Furthermore, we hope that the MOTUS continental alliance, through its network of radio towers, will provide precise information about the duration of migration and migratory routes of this and other species.

3) Stopover ecology of migratory landbirds in the Caribbean tropical dry forests of Colombia
In 2016, occupancy surveys carried out under the Neotropical Flyways Project identified tropical dry forests as a key stopover habitat during spring migration for a range of species that over-winter elsewhere in South America. This previously unknown role of these forests in maintaining migratory processes, highlights the need for increasing our knowledge of how birds use these areas. This need is even more critical given that tropical dry forests have lost 92% of their original cover in Colombia and are used by declining migrants such as Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Alder Flycatcher and Mourning Warbler. The deployment of Motus tags in this project will enable the estimation of key parameters of stopover behavior, such as duration, as well as describe onward migratory strategies.

76,2015-01-01,"Control of nocturnal departure times","Helgoland","Most nocturnal songbird migrants travel without social guidance between the breeding and wintering areas. To arrive at the correct place and time, their innate migration program defines the spatiotemporal organisation of migration and their reactions to the environment. When birds are kept in cages during migration, they show nocturnal activity, “migratory restlessness”. The temporal pattern and intensity of migratory restlessness is endogenously controlled. However, changes in photoperiod, temperature, and body condition modulate the seasonal pattern. These factors also influence the departure probability of a migrant at a stopover site. Although the circannual and circadian rhythms in migrants and their realised migration behaviour are well studied, we have little information (i) about the start of nocturnal migratory restlessness and the onset of nocturnal migration, (ii) whether both traits are temporally related, (iii) whether they are strongly endogenous controlled, and (iv) which exogenous factors influence the timing of both traits.
The onset of nocturnal migration defines the potential flight range per night. The seasonal sum of all potential flight ranges per night influences total speed of migration which in turn affects the timing of migration. For our understanding of migration it is essential investigating which endogenous and exogenous factors influence the onset of nocturnal migration.
	By combining cage experiments to determine the start of nocturnal migratory restlessness and radio telemetry to identify the onset of nocturnal migration for the same individual we will (i) describe the temporal pattern of both traits, (ii) whether both traits correlate temporally with each other and identify how (iii) endogenous and (iv) exogenous factors influence the timing of both traits within the night. To this end, Northern Wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) will be caught on Helgoland a small island in the North Sea. On migration the nominate form breeding in Scandinavian and the leucorhoa subspecies breeding on Island, Greenland, and in Canada pass regularly Helgoland. As they all winter in sub-Sahelian Africa, populations have depending on their breeding areas different remaining migration distances from Helgoland in spring but not in autumn. This framework allows testing differences in both traits in respect of total migration distance [endogenous factor], remaining migration distance, temperature, body condition and weather [all exogenous factors].

We found that movements span over 500 km from the breeding area, differing strikingly by age. Adults moved south, reducing the distance they must travel during migration. Juveniles, however, moved randomly, exploring widely across the landscape.  Our results contrast markedly with most previous work, which has been executed within a small proximity to breeding grounds and suggest movements are motivated by habitat requirements.

This location is an extensive reedbed that hosts a banding station which has been active since the 1970s. It is well known as an important stopover site for marshland species, such as reed warblers.

In a future step, the network should be extended to areas in the Alps. We envision the area around Grünau im Almtal, not far from the city of Salzburg, where a research station of the University of Vienna is located.

We will look at effects of adverse weather, phenology, and other factors on the strategies of migration, and will be able to directl< compare sites at the mountain edge with sites in the Eastern plains, where no barrier is present.

137,2017-03-09,"Abiotic and biotic influences on Snowfinch","Snowfinch","The mechanisms regulating populations are poorly understood and controversial, yet elucidating them is essential for predicting how populations will respond to environmental perturbations such as climate change. The combination of the exogenous (e.g. climate) and endogenous (e.g. dispersal limitation) forces acting upon a population will determine its fate, including the probability that a population goes extinct, and the probability that new populations will be established as a result of colonisations. In this project we will address one of the most pertinent questions in ecology, which relates to the relative roles of abiotic and biotic factors in shaping patterns of species abundance, distribution, and spatio-temporal population dynamics. As all population-level phenomena can be derived from individual-level processes, our starting point for assessing population dynamics is to understand how individual-level processes (e.g. dispersal patterns and group movement dynamics) translate to populaion-level processes,  as well as to understand how individual-level process are modified by the population context. Our biological model is one of the most emblematic passerine species of alpine environments in European mountains, the snowfinch Montifringilla nivalis nivalis. As most organisms inhabiting alpine environments, the snowfinch is potentially threatened by loss of habitat, range contraction and local extinction due to global warming. However, we still know very little about its ecological requirements and essentially nothing about its demography in order to adequately assess its vulnerability. By identifying the mechanisms limiting population locally, and mechanistically linking the dynamics of the populations with climatic variability, we aim to gain insights into the relative importance of abiotic a biotic factors on the spatio-temporal dynamics of snowfinch populations - the results of which is a fundamental requirement in order to assess how alpine species adapated to cold climate will face new warming conditions. We believe that the project will serve as an important case study that will significantly advance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of bird populations in alpine environments, a topic for which a general synthesis is very important but still lacking. Thus, we expect that our results and methods will be applicable also to other researchers. The project is therefore expected to make significant advance in the 'state of the art' of alpine habitat conservation and management in Europe, as well as to get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying alpine bird responses to climate change.","Abiotic and Biotic Influences on Spatio-temporal Population Dynamics in Alpine Environmental Conditions: the snowfinches as a case study"

Ovenbirds will be nanotagged on their nesting territories in Connecticut and assigned to a dosing group or control group. Throughout the breeding period, birds in the dosing group will be supplemental fed in the field with mealworms that have been maintained on a diet containing an environmentally relevant concentration of methylmercury-cysteine while birds in the control group will receive clean mealworms.Ovenbirds that breed in Connecticut and elsewhere east of the Appalachian Mountains migrate to the Caribbean islands for the winter. The fall migration route likely follows the Atlantic Coast, passes through the Florida peninsula, and then continues either east to the Bahamas or south to the Greater Antilles. As such,we expect that the majority of the birds will be detected when they reach the “fence” of Motus towers that currently stretches east-west across northern Florida. The dates on which birds are detected in Florida relative to the date they left their breeding grounds in Connecticut will allow us to calculate and compare the speed (flight and stopover periods combined) with which mercury-dosed and non-dosed birds moved south.

147,2017-04-10,"Southern Great Plains Snowy Plover","SNPL","In this study, we will focus on highly isolated populations on the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, that have experienced >75% declines in the last decade. Habitat degradation due to human disturbance, vegetation encroachment, stochastic weather events and high nest predation rates are all known influences on population declines of Snowy Plovers. On the SGP, however, decreasing availability of surface water on saline lakes is an additional limiting factor to Snowy Plover nest success and survival. What remains unknown about Snowy Plovers on the SGP is the existence, level and degree of population connectivity among regional saline lakes and other breeding areas. This is important to regional conservation efforts; identifying those populations that are most isolated is the first step identifying management effort direction. We propose to address this paucity of data by utilizing uniquely-coded nanotag technology, and automated VHF receivers, in collaboration with the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network, to track and record breeding season movements and winter migration patterns of SGP Snowy Plovers during the 2017 and 2018 breeding seasons.","Monitoring population connectivity of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) on the Southern Great Plains of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma"

168,2017-07-28,"Montreal moult migrant research","MONTREAL_MOULT","To provide accurate environmental impact assessments in urban environments, it is important to understand how sensitive species, such as migrating birds, use those environments. Moult-migrant songbirds perform extended stopovers during migration in order to moult their feathers before reaching their wintering grounds. Stopover habitats are therefore of great importance to the continued survival of these species. However, as urbanization keeps altering habitat throughout the world, many of these important areas are disappearing or are under constant threat of development. In this study, we will investigate how molt-migrants are using the landscape during moulting stopovers in one of the largest metropolis in Canada and where migratory birds from large swathes of the boreal forest migrate past, the island of Montreal. We will determine the fall stopover duration, fine-scale habitat use and departure decisions of moult-migrant Swainson’s thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and Tennessee Warblers (Leiothlypis peregrina) using the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. We will deploy radio transmitters on several individuals of both species at an important migratory bird stopover area located in the western tip of the island of Montreal. We will then record their daily general location and movements through an array of 3 automated radio telemetry towers set up in the surrounding areas of our study site. Using manual radio telemetry, we will follow and monitor each individual bird throughout the duration of its stopover and record behaviour and habitat use. We will assess the duration of stopover, stopover behaviour and departure decisions as a function of species, age, moulting stage, body condition and local weather conditions. We will also associate behavioural data with the signal strengths detected by the towers with the hopes of creating activity budgets of the tagged birds based on our behavioural data validated in the field.

Nighthawks and whip-poor- wills are migratory, crepuscular, cryptic ground-nesting birds that belong to the nightjar family. Breeding Bird Survey data from 1966-2011 indicate that Common Nighthawk numbers have dropped by -2.2%/year across their summer range (Sauer et al. 2013), and provincial and national trends from 2002-2012 show that in Canada, Eastern Whip-poor-wills are declining at a rate between -2.77%/year and -5.53%/year (Environment Canada 2015). Both nightjars are listed as threatened under the Species at Risk Act, but given their secretive nature and relative difficulty of researching nightjars, knowledge gaps have prevented us from pinpointing a direct cause of these declines. The primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate the potential influence of roadways on Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will breeding success and increase our understanding of factors driving their range- wide declines. My goals include improving methods for nightjar nest-monitoring and conservation of both species. Given the aforementioned aspects of nighthawk and whip-poor-will breeding ecology combined with numerous possible attractive features of roadways, it is impossible to overlook the potential threats to survival posed by even a single high-speed road cutting through otherwise appropriate habitat. We hypothesize that roadways bisecting breeding habitat for the Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will may present an ecological trap either in the classical sense, where adults erroneously favour poor-quality habitat near roadway edges over more suitable open woodlands and suffer reduced fitness as a result, or alternatively as an equal preference trap where nighthawks and whip-poor-wills in close proximity to roadways experience consequences to fitness from which those remaining in the habitat interior are exempt. Conversely, nighthawks and whip-poor-wills may be able to recognize the poorer quality of roadside habitats and avoid them altogether, resulting in much higher density of nighthawks and whip-poor-wills located a significant distance from the road’s edge.
Objectives:
Obtain refined knowledge of territory size and movements on Common Nighthawks and Eastern Whip-poor-wills on breeding grounds in Ontario

Specifically, we propose to attach nanotags to a sample of Second Year and After Second Year male Painted Buntings and document their home range and territory sizes.  Based on the female mimicry hypothesis, we plan to test the prediction that SY males should range relatively widely by visiting multiple Painted Bunting territories, whereas ASY males should confine their movements primarily to within their home territories.

Further, by using nanotags as part of the MOTUS system we will be able to answer several questions related to Painted Bunting southward migration.  We have an established automated MOTUS receiving station at our study area, the Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA).  Thus, the MOTUS system should allow us to detect nanotagged Painted Buntings daily as long as they remain on their breeding territories.  As soon as a signal is not detected, we should be able to determine the exact day or evening that individual Painted Buntings initiated migration.  There are also 18 automated MOTUS receiving systems located along the Gulf Coast from Galveston to Brownsville, Texas, 500-900 km south and southeast of our LLELA study area.  If our nanotagged Painted Buntings migrate more-or-less directly southward to the Gulf Coast, the MOTUS stations on the Gulf Coast have a relatively high probability of detecting our tagged birds.

231,2018-11-30,"American Tree Sparrows - Ontario","ATSP","The objectives of this study are to utilize several bird tracking technologies to answer some fundamental questions regarding habitat use, movement patterns and winter survivorship in this species. Specifically, we plan to use miniature light-level geolocators to better define the breeding range, migration routes, and migration timing of wintering American Tree Sparrows. While powerful, geolocators must be recovered from individual birds recaptured during a subsequent winter, and we will be extending considerable effort to recapture birds carrying geolocators. Given that return rates of birds between winters is quite low, we expect to only recover a small percentage of transmitters. To bolster our sample sizes and better define the breeding grounds for this species, we also plan to use stable isotopes from feathers. This method will allow us to define the regional breeding range for a much larger sample of birds, without the need to subsequently recapture birds. Finally, we also plan to attach coded transmitters (e.g. Nanotags) to a subset of birds as a means of tracking local bird movements during winter. Since Nanotags communicate with a dense external network of towers, once transmitters are deployed, birds do not have to be recaptured and transmitters do not have to be recovered to retrieve data. Nanotags can track bird movements at much finer spatial scales than geolocators, but their lifespan is much shorter. Through a combined approach, also using stationary and hand-held receivers and field observations, we plan to use these tracking technologies to further our understanding of movement and habitat use in this species. The goal of this project is to identify critical stages and locations within the annual cycle that, through conservation and management, lead to actions which slow or reverse population declines.","Winter ecology of American Tree Sparrows in Southern Ontario"

The status of TRBL is also currently under formal review for Federal listing under the Endangered Species Act.  Breeding by Tricolored Blackbirds in low elevation grasslands in the foothills surrounding California’s Central Valley (“foothill grasslands”) has been well documented but relatively little is known about these populations.  Ariola (et al. 2015) estimated that 30% of the state’s TRBL population occurs in these areas.  However, there is insufficient data on the movements of these birds, including whether these populations are year-long residents, migrants, or a mix of both.  In the Kern River Valley, some of the birds also appear to shift breeding sites during the breeding season.  We plan to fit 30 TRBLs (from at least two separate colonies) with nanoTags to track their movements within the Kern River Valley.

We will use the existing network of towers, and erect new stations in areas where we have some gaps in order to obtain information on contemporary migration patterns and to annually estimate adult survival rates.

As a pilot feasibility study, we plan to trap geese on Prince Edward Island during the spring migration and equip a subset (100) birds with nanotags (Lotek NTQB-6-2; 2 years life span) to determine detection on geese in subsequent seasons. Spring banding on PEI had previously been an operational program, but due to an inability to capture and band hatch year geese, safety concerns over rocket charges, and difficulties in banding adequate numbers of geese (estimated at 600-700 AHY annually), this was abandoned in favor of a breeding ground banding effort.  Many of the fields that had previously be used held geese in spring 2018, so the expectation is that we will be able to reinstitute banding programs in those areas moving forward.

We will leg band and deploy nanotags on all geese captured.  Radios will be attached to geese using a standard Teflon® harness.  By continuing this program over multiple years, we hope to be able to obtain data on migration timing and routes for up to 7 years, and a time series of mark-recapture information for survival rate estimation of a similar duration.  By marking birds with both leg bands and nanotag technology, we will be able to maximize the information return on our investment.  Our intent is to conduct traditional band return analyses in conjunction with the estimates of survival derived from the nanotags.  This would enable us utilize our sample of banded and telemetered NAP geese most effectively.  

If satisfied with the detection rates after the first year of banding on PEI, we expect to transition to the breeding grounds and annually capture both adult flocks and brood flocks in Labrador and Newfoundland, as well as potentially continuing the spring banding in PEI.  As a hedge, we anticipate deploying a limited number of GSM/GPS units on adults as a test against the nanotag deployments and to get more complete life histories on breeding geese in Labrador and Newfoundland. In this case, sample sizes are considerably reduced from that required when relying solely on leg banded birds to provide survival and harvest rate information.","Assessment of harvest rates, and timing of arrival and duration of stay for south-migrating North Atlantic Population Canada geese."

309,2020-02-12,"Linking Least Tern wintering and breeding sites","Least Tern wintering","Conservation of Least Terns in the U.S. receives considerable attention – from May through August.

During the remaining 8 months, however, we know very little about the distribution and ecology of the species.  In fact, because most fledglings do not return to breeding colonies until 2 or 3 years of age, the whereabouts of a 15-year-old nesting Least Tern would be completely unknown for about 70% of its life. Also unknown is information about any possible threats the species might face away from the nesting areas.

This proposal will make use of the MOTUS Wildlife Tracking System. NanoTags will be attached ""to the interscapular region using cyanoacrylate adhesive and held in place with subcutaneous sutures"" (https://doi.org/10.5751/ACE-01086-120220). This project will reverse the normal approach used by most studies of bird movements between North and South America, in which individuals are marked on the North American breeding grounds and then hopefully tracked via data recorded during their migration to and from unknown wintering destinations. Instead, we will capture non-breeding birds using mist nets at one or two wintering sites along the northern and eastern coast of Brazil (Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia), and then detect the northward movement of these birds as they pass near the extensive network of MOTUS receiving towers en route to breeding colonies in the U.S. Birds captured in Brazil during the winter months likely breed along the eastern seaboard of the U.S., although some may also return to breeding sites in northern South America, the Caribbean, or the Mississippi River drainage.

Mist-netting operations in Brazil will be conducted in cooperation with Dr. Pedro Lima, a Brazilian veterinarian who holds blanket permits for capturing wild birds throughout the country (Cetrel S/A Empressa De Protecas Ambiental Do Polo Petrocemico De Camacari, Interligacao Estrada Do Coco Km 9, CEP 42810, 000, Camacari, Bahia, Brazil). This approach will (a) eliminate the need to trap birds on nests, (b) enable the use of very small transmitters that fall well under the 3% weight limit for auxiliary markers, and (c) allow the field component of the work to be accomplished by a small team of researchers over an approximately 1 month period (December-January 2021).

- How do bats behave during over-sea migration? Which flight routes and heights do they use? Specific flight routes may complete the knowledge on agglomerations. If bats fly in the  altitude  of offshore wind turbines may influence the collision risk significantly.
- How do over-sea migrating bats behave at vertical structures like offshore wind turbines? Do they change their flight height? Do they show exploration behaviour? Behaviour patterns like the existence of exploration behaviour at offshore wind turbines may increase the collision risk significantly.
The results shall serve as a basis for the inference of spatial plan and technical mitigation measures. Further standard methods for the investigation of bats in specific offshore wind farm projects shall be developed. These may be implemented in the approval procedures of authorities in Germany.

334,2020-07-06,"Poplar Island Restoration Site - Common Terns","Poplar Terns","Common terns are considered endangered within the state of Maryland (Maryland Wildlife and Heritage Service, 2016) ), and receive protections within several other states throughout the Northeast United States, due in large part to a dramatic loss in breeding habitat. The largest, and only consistently active, common tern breeding colony remaining in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay is located on Poplar Island, a large scale environmental restoration site. Due to its importance and the myriad challenges presented by the continuously changing habitat on this active restoration site, the Poplar Island colony has been intensively researched through a collaboration between USGS and USFWS staff since 2013 (ACUC 2013-05). These efforts have consisted of nest searches 2-3 times per week, during which (1) all identified nests are marked and their status recorded, and (2) all located chicks are banded with both a stainless steel BBL band and a Plastic Field Readable band. In the following weeks extensive efforts are made to resight or recapture banded chicks in order to estimate survival. While these efforts have provided considerable insight into the viability of this locally important colony as well as the factors that drive reproductive success and recruitment in common tern populations, best management of this state endangered species still requires further investigation of several issues and questions at this site. 

One area of particular interest to researchers and managers alike is understanding how common terns use the broader Chesapeake Bay outside of Poplar Island. Specifically, there is interest in better understanding how much of the day birds spend at the colony and where they forage/loaf when they leave the island. Collecting such data would help identify important foraging and loafing areas and potentially allow for appropriate protections to be put in place in other areas. At a broader scale, state biologists are interested in receiving information regarding the annual migration of this species. Fortunately, a Motus automated telemetry tower with receiving capabilities for both the traditional Motus network and the newer 434 mHz frequency bandwidth was installed on Poplar Island in fall of 2019. This tower, along with the network of others along the east coast provides an excellent opportunity to study both localized and migratory movements (Taylor et al. 2017). While this approach does not provide fine scale spatial data, it does provide valuable information regarding time budgets at a low cost. Additionally, the recent release of CTT LifeTags, Motus Nanotags, and light weight GPS loggers allows for precise spatial information, far beyond that available from the use of the Motus network, to be captured via light weight transmitters.

The capture of terns required for our ongoing work and the new deployment of transmitters provides the opportunity to collect additional data without further disturbing the colony. Specifically,  the high degree of interspecies contact paired with (1) the previous involvement of common terns in avian influenza outbreaks (Becker 1966) and (2) the reemergence of questions regarding the role of waterbirds in avian influenz a ecology (Bahnson et al. 2020) has led to concern about potential disease risk both on Poplar Island and within the region at large. These concerns were further escalated following an outbreak of botulism at this site in the summer of 2019 (pers. comm. Peter McGowan, USFWS). Fortunately, these questions can be explored by collecting cloacal swabs from captured individuals. Additionally, there is currently no microbiome data recorded for common terns despite the relative ease of collecting such data once birds are already in-hand. This would be an ideal opportunity to investigate bacterial and viral presence with our ongoing work, along with comparing new born chicks to their parents.

Objectives: In FY20 we will capture a combination of juvenile and adult common terns on Poplar Island, collect avian influenza and microbiome samples and affix nanotags or GPS loggers. In FY21-24 we aim to continue collecting avian influenza and microbiome samples during our ongoing efforts of banding terns approved in ACUC 2013-05. We aim to conduct data analysis throughout the project period, updating each year with new data that is attained.

Methods: 

Capture
We will seek to capture adult common terns via the use of bownet and treadle traps as is standard for this species (Loring et al. 2018, Wiseman 2018), with trapping taking place after a full clutch is laid to minimize the risk of nest abandonment (Nisbet 1981). In order to ensure the safety of the eggs during trap efforts we will remove eggs from the nest and place them in an incubator. We will place decoy eggs in the nest while the trap is in place, returning the real eggs only once the trap has been removed (standard procedures, pers. comm. Dave Brinker, MDNR). We will capture chicks by hand in the same manner as used for our ongoing work with this species. We aim to capture 100 adult common terns and all chicks (estimate 400+, as currently takes place under ACUC 2013-05). We will also continue our regular capture of all least tern chicks as part of ongoing work.

Animal Handling
Birds will be processed soon after capture in a shaded area removed from the colony to limit additional disturbance to other nests. All individuals will be weighed, marked with a BBL stainless steel band and a Plastic Field Readable band, have various morphometric measurements taken, and be photographed (these are ongoing efforts previously approved through ACUC 2013-05). To gather as much data as possible while birds are in-hand we will also collect a cheek swab to allow for sexing of the individual, followed by the collection of two cloacal swabs. The first cloacal swab will be tested for avian influenza while the second will be processed to determine microbiome. Additionally, depending upon availability, fecal samples may be collected opportunistically for microbiome analysis. While we will be collecting the samples at this time they will likely be stored until funds can be obtained to proceed with a larger cooperative study to examine avian influenza and microbiome in terns and perhaps broader waterbird populations. The collection of this data presents an opportunity to collect additional data from birds which are already being captured for the pre-existing research on Poplar Island, and reduce separate disturbance events to the population. Standard operating procedures will be followed for avian influenza (FAO 2007 and Prosser ACUC 2014-02), genetic sexing and microbiome sampling (Brubaker 2011, Karouna and Drovetski Microbiome protocol, and follows sampling protocol for avian influenza as in Prosser ACUC 2014-02).

Finally, a subset of the captured individuals (common terns only) will be fit with nanotags or GPS loggers, with the others serving as a control which will allow us to identify if any reductions in reproductive success are the result of handling or tagging. We intend to mark up to 50 adult and 50 juvenile common terns with the smaller vhf tags: Lotek solar nanotags  and Cellular Tracking Technologies (CTT) Solar LifeTags. Only adult common terns would be marked with  Pathtack GPS Loggers (up to 10 adults). Marking of juveniles will target 14 days of age or older so they are closer to their fledging mass. If all units are not deployed in year one, we will plan to deploy the remaining in the following years. We are currently conducting extensive research to determine the safest and most effective attachment methods and materials for applying these tags on the terns (Berlin ACUC 2012-07). While all data have not yet been analyzed, both expert opinion and our own results suggest that leg loop harnesses are the most appropriate path forward. However, we will adjust this approach if any concerns arise. The total package weight (tag plus harness) for our transmitters varies by type (CTT = ~1.5g , Lotek and PathTrack = ~2g), but will be less than the recommended 3% of the tagged birds body mass. It should be noted that birds captured and swabbed, but not fit with tracking units, will serve as controls to differentiate any effect of handling versus tagging.
