SensorGnome GPS sensor is located on roof of cabin, approximately 3.7m from ground level. \n\nThis receiver was deployed on 16 June 2017 in order to replace the previous Beaglebone unit which ceased functioning during the 2016 field season.  There were no changes to the location or arrangement of the antennas, or the other components of the SensorGnome what were still functional. The previous BeagleBone unit was deployed on 21 June 2015, and had its final data download completed on 23 Jul 2016. This receiver was removed at the conclusion of our study in July of 2019, with the final data download occurring on 21 Jul 2019. \n\nWe are planning to resume work at this site in ~2026.
