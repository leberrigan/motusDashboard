# Motus dashboard

## Done: not in *master*
* [x] Save page as PDF
* [x] Generate summary to display prior to detailed profile page.

## In development
 * [ ] Improve PDF output by adding more summary data and a table or two
 * [ ] Tidy initial summary displayed prior to detailed profile page so there's lots of white space and it's extremely clear what's going on.

## Next
 * [ ] Highlight regions where stations/tagDeps exist in all profile pages
 * [ ] Improve map control interface on profiles
 * [ ] Introduce custom selections
 * [ ] Pare down code so fewer scripts are required
